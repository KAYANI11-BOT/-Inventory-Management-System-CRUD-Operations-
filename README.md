# -Inventory-Management-System-CRUD-Operations-
I'm excited to share my recent project, a fully functional Inventory Management System developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.  This application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) inventory items through a clean and user-friendly interface. Itâ€™s designed with both functionality and usability, perfect  for CRUD-based systems.
